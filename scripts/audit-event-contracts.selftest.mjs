// Self-test for scripts/audit-event-contracts.mjs.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// A guard that never fails protects nothing, and a guard that fails for the
// wrong reason gets deleted. Both failure modes look identical from outside the
// audit: in the first it prints OK, in the second it prints a plausible list.
// The only way to know which one you have is to make it fail on purpose and
// check that it fails for the stated reason.
//
// Each case mutates exactly one file, runs the audit, asserts the exit code and
// the text it produced, then restores the file and re-hashes it. A restore that
// does not reproduce the original bytes aborts the whole run: a self-test that
// corrupts the tree is worse than no self-test at all.
//
// NOT part of `pnpm check`. It writes to src/ by design, and a CI job that
// mutates source is a hazard rather than a check. Run it by hand whenever the
// audit changes: `pnpm audit:events:selftest`.
//
// The cases are chosen to pin down the two structural signals that decide
// whether a call is a bus emission (see "ONE CHANNEL, NOT THREE" in the audit),
// because both were added only after a check failed — T1/T2/T3 fail if either
// signal is weakened, T4 fails if the scoping is dropped and non-bus channels
// are judged against ServerEventMap again.
//
// T12/T13/T14 exercise check 9 (declared -> emitted) from the RED side: a new
// declared-but-unemitted name, a baseline entry that gained a producer, and a
// baseline entry whose declaration was removed. A check whose self-test only
// proves the green path is worthless, so each of the three failure branches
// gets its own case.

/**
 * T13/T14 act on a REAL baseline entry, so read the subject OUT of the audit
 * script instead of hardcoding a name.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical polish. T13 was originally pinned to
 * `network:dns_resolved`; when that event was actually wired up it left the
 * baseline, after which T13 injected a producer for a name the baseline no
 * longer contained — exit 0, "FAIL — expected 1", testing nothing. T14 was
 * subtler and worse: it kept passing, but only because deleting the declaration
 * tripped a DIFFERENT check (an emitted-but-undeclared failure), so it silently
 * stopped covering the branch its own label claims.
 *
 * Deriving the name makes both cases follow the baseline automatically. If the
 * extraction yields nothing we ABORT rather than run a vacuous test.
