// Event contract audit.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// `ServerEventMap` (src/server/EventBus.ts) used to declare an index signature
// alongside its named events:
//
//   export interface ServerEventMap {
//     [key: string]: unknown;   // ← deleted; check 1 keeps it deleted
//     'tool:activated': { ... };
//     ...
//   }
//
// That index signature widened `keyof ServerEventMap` to `string | number`, so
// every nominally-typed event API in the repo — `EventBus.emit`,
// `EventBus.on`, `emitBusEvent`, `emitEvent`, `emitWebSocketEvent` — accepted
// ANY string. Event names were effectively untyped: nothing in the compiler and
// nothing in the test suite noticed a wrong name, and nothing noticed when the
// code that was supposed to emit a name disappeared.
//
// It has since been deleted. That cost 12 call-site fixes and surfaced five
// events that were being emitted undeclared. Check 1 exists so it cannot come
// back — re-adding it silently reverts all of the above.
//
// Three instances were found by hand:
//
//   1. `adb:device_connected` — subscribed by an ActivationController boost
//      rule, emitted by nothing. The emitter was deleted in b428982b; e36194d9
//      restored the tool but not the emit. The rule could not fire, and
//      `ActivationController.test.ts` (`listenerCount(...) === 1`) stayed green
//      the whole time — a subscription-only assertion cannot detect a missing
//      producer.
//   2. `task:update` — subscribed by SseStream, emitted only by SseStream's own
//      test. (SseStream was additionally never constructed anywhere in src/ at
//      the time; it now is, and TaskManager is its producer.)
//   3. Five emitted-but-undeclared names: `frida:spawned`,
//      `network:http2_probed`, `network:http2_frame_build_completed`,
//      `network:rtt_measured`, `task:update`.
//
// A subscription with no producer is the silent half of this defect class: the
// handler registers successfully, and the feature simply never runs. So this
// audit asks one question per contract entry:
//
//   does any code in src/ actually emit this event name?
//
// FAILS THE BUILD
//   1. `ServerEventMap` must not declare a string index signature.
//   2. no event may be emitted on the bus in src/ without being declared in
//      ServerEventMap. Only emissions that resolve to the bus count — see
//      "ONE CHANNEL, NOT THREE" below.
//   3. every default boost rule's `eventPattern` must have a literal producer.
//   4. every `SSE_EVENT_ALLOWLIST` entry must have a literal producer.
//   5. every file under src/ must parse — an unparsed file is invisible here.
//   6. no contract entry may have a name shape the scanner cannot recognise.
//      Without this an unsupported name would be reported dead, blaming the
//      event for a limitation of the scanner.
//   7. no `*Contract.ts` module under src/ may be imported by nothing. See
//      "CONTRACT MODULES WITH NO CONSUMER" below.
//   8. every name declared in a well-known-name object — `SpanNames` /
//      `MetricNames` (instrumentation) and `WorkflowSpanNames` (workflow engine
//      spans) — must be emitted from a real call site in src/, as a
//      `SpanNames.x` / `MetricNames.y` / `WorkflowSpanNames.z` argument. A
//      declared-but-unemitted name is a promise with no producer — the shape
//      that kept the whole instrumentation module dead for six months while its
//      header claimed it was "used by default". The declaring modules are listed
//      in NAME_CONST_SOURCES; each must contribute, or the check passes
//      vacuously for it.
//   9. every event declared in `ServerEventMap` must have at least one literal
//      producer in src/, outside the declaration file (`EventBus.ts`) and the
//      SSE consumer (`EventsEndpoint.ts`). This is the direction check 2 does
//      NOT cover: check 2 asks "is every emitted name declared?", check 9 asks
//      "is every declared name emitted?". A declaration with no producer is a
//      subscription target that can never fire. Eleven names are a REASONED
//      baseline — see "DECLARED-BUT-UNEMITTED BASELINE" below.
//
// ONE CHANNEL, NOT THREE
// ----------------------
// The repo has three unrelated things that are all called "emitting an event":
//
//   1. the server EventBus (`ServerEventMap`) — `bus.emit`, `emitBusEvent`, ...
//   2. the webhook channel — `ExtensionRegistryHandlers.emitEvent` forwards to
//      `WebhookBridge.sendEvent`, filtered by each webhook's `events` list
//   3. the span/metric collectors — `WorkflowEngine`'s `emitSpan`/`emitMetric`
//      push onto local arrays that are returned as part of the run result
//
// A first version of check 2 matched any callee whose name contains "emit",
// which conflated all three. It reported 11 names — `extension.*`, `macro.*`,
// `workflow.*` — as "emitted but undeclared". Every one was a false positive.
//
// Declaring them in `ServerEventMap` would have been worse than the bug. The
// map is a statement about what the bus can carry; a name declared there but
// only ever sent over a webhook or pushed onto a span array is a subscription
// target that can never fire — precisely the "silent half" defect class this
// audit was written to catch. A guard that manufactures the bug it hunts is
// worse than no guard.
//
// So the scan is scoped by structural facts read off the source, rather than
// by a hand-kept list. A call counts as a bus emission when EITHER holds:
//
//   a. the file references the bus contract (`ServerEventMap` / `EventBus`) —
//      or declares a class that inherits, transitively within src/, from a
//      class in such a file. Most bus emissions are calls to an INHERITED
//      typed helper, so the inheritance hop is not optional;
//   b. the call's own receiver names the bus — `this.ctx.eventBus.emit(...)`,
//      which occurs in files that never name the bus type.
//
// Both signals were found the hard way, by a check failing:
//
//   - Without (b), the file test dropped four live bus emissions
//     (`frida:attached`, `frida:spawned`, `v8:heap_captured`, `tool:progress`),
//     and the BOOST-RULE check caught the loss by reporting their rules dead.
//   - Without the inheritance hop in (a), two of the five canaries vanished and
//     the scan aborted.
//
// Emissions matching neither signal are reported as a non-fatal DIAGNOSTIC, not
// a failure: they are the webhook and span channels, whose names must NOT be
// declared in `ServerEventMap`.
//
// Known limit, stated rather than hidden: an emission on a receiver typed
// `any`, in a file that never names the bus, is neither checked by `tsc` nor
// failed here. It still appears in the diagnostic listing.
//
// DECLARED-BUT-UNEMITTED BASELINE
// -------------------------------
// Check 9 is the reverse of check 2, and the two are not symmetric. Check 2
// asks "is every emitted name declared?"; check 9 asks "is every declared name
// emitted?". A name declared in `ServerEventMap` is a promise that some code
// will emit it; a subscription to a name nothing emits is the "silent half"
// defect this audit exists to catch, and check 2 structurally cannot see it
// because there is no producer to scan.
//
// Eleven names were declared without a producer when this audit was written. Ten
// of them have since been WIRED and now have real producers — see the history
// block further down and the `UNEMITTED_EVENT_BASELINE` array, which is ratcheted
// in both directions so a baseline entry cannot outlive the gap it records.
// `task:update` is one of the ten: `TaskManager` emits it on six transitions and
// `SseStream` IS constructed (it is what turns those into SSE frames).
//
// Exactly one declared-but-unemitted name remains: `domain:unloaded`. It is kept
// because deleting it would remove the typed subscription it exists to serve,
// and baselined so the ratchet above will fail the build the moment it gains a
// producer or stops being declared.
//
// The reason this paragraph exists at all: it is the claim most likely to rot in
// a file that exists to catch rot. The baseline array and the history block are
// the source of truth; if they disagree with this comment, they are right.
//
// Producers are matched by EXACT literal, not by EVENT_NAME_RE. Check 9 already
// knows the precise set of names it is looking for, so it does not need the
// event-shape heuristic the emitted->declared direction relies on. That matters
// concretely: `evidence-evicted` is a declared name that IS emitted —
// `ReverseEvidenceGraph.ts` calls `.emit('evidence-evicted', ...)` — but its
// hyphen-only shape is deliberately outside EVENT_NAME_RE. Reusing the filtered
// producer set would report a live event as dead, blaming the event for a
// limitation of the scanner; matching the exact declared name reads it right.
//
// CONTRACT MODULES WITH NO CONSUMER
// ---------------------------------
// Check 7 is not about events. It lives here because it is the same question
// one level up: a module whose whole job is to declare a contract, that nothing
// imports, is a promise nothing keeps.
//
// `src/server/observability/InstrumentationContract.ts` was exactly that. It
// shipped in 0e05f885 ("add B-skeleton contracts (Plugin, Workflow,
// Instrumentation)") alongside PluginContract and WorkflowContract. Those two
// were wired up — 7 and 15 importing files. This one never was: zero importers
// for six months, while its own header claimed "NoopInstrumentation is used by
// default until a real exporter is configured" and nothing constructed it. Its
// sibling `config/config.schema.json` from the same commit was deleted long
// ago; the whole `config/` directory is gone.
//
// What kept it alive was its tests. Both suites asserted the constants equal
// the literals they were defined as —
// `expect(SpanNames.toolExecute).toBe('tool.execute')` — which cannot fail when
// reality drifts, because reality is never consulted. A test that only reads
// the thing under test is not coverage; it is a copy.
//
// So it was deleted, and this check makes the next one fail loudly. The rule
// asks about importers rather than "is this useful": a contract module with no
// importer has no implementation to be right or wrong about.
//
// SCANNER MECHANICS — AND ITS HONEST LIMITS
// -----------------------------------------
// Producers are found by parsing every file in src/ with @babel/parser and
// inspecting call expressions whose callee name contains "emit"; a
// string-literal argument that looks like an event name is a
// producer. Consequences, all deliberate:
//
//   - Argument POSITION is never assumed. The repo has at least five shapes —
//     `bus.emit(name, payload)`, `this.emitEvent(name, payload)`,
//     `emitEvent(bus, name, payload)`, `emitBusEvent(bus, name, payload)`,
//     `emitWebSocketEvent(name, payload)` — and the name is argument 1 in some
//     and argument 2 in others. An earlier position-based scan reported a live
//     event as dead for exactly this reason.
//   - Parsing (not text matching) is used on purpose. Sources are parsed with
//     @babel/parser — already a direct dependency — because a hand-rolled lexer
//     that blanked comments before scanning silently failed on this file set: a
//     quote inside a regex literal put it into an unterminated string state,
//     after which every comment was treated as code and a commented-out emit
//     still counted as a producer. Comments are simply not AST nodes, so
//     parsing cannot make that mistake.
//   - The scan OVER-APPROXIMATES: any event-shaped literal inside any emit-ish
//     call counts, even if it is not really an event name. This can hide a
//     dead entry; it can never invent one. That direction is chosen on purpose
//     — a guard that cries wolf gets deleted, and then protects nothing.
//   - Which files may contribute producers is decided by ONE structural test:
//     does the file reference `ServerEventMap` or `EventBus`? This is derived
//     from source, not from a hand-maintained list of "files allowed to emit",
//     because a hand-kept copy of the truth is what rots in the first place.
//     It is applied as a plain regex over the file text, so a file that merely
//     mentions the bus in a comment counts as bus-capable — over-inclusive,
//     which errs toward checking more rather than fewer emissions.
//   - Dynamic event names (a variable or a substituted template literal) are
//     counted and reported, never treated as producers.
//
// A scanner that can only report "dead" cannot distinguish a dead event from a
// scanner that stopped matching. So the scan is gated on CANARIES: a fixed set
// of known-live names, one per call shape, each independent of the contract
// tables wherever such a name exists. If a canary stops being found the audit
// ABORTS instead of reporting, because its output would be meaningless.
//
