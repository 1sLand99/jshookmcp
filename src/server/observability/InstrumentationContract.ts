/**
 * Instrumentation contract for jshookmcp.
 *
 * A minimal span/metric interface that can be backed by OpenTelemetry,
 * Prometheus, or a no-op implementation. `NoopInstrumentation` is the default
 * (zero overhead); `InMemoryInstrumentation` is the in-process option; a real
 * exporter implements this same interface and replaces it wholesale.
 *
 * WHY THE INVARIANT BELOW MATTERS
 * -------------------------------
 * This contract was added on 2026-03-03 and sat with ZERO consumers for six
 * months, while its own header claimed it was "used by default". The names in
 * `SpanNames`/`MetricNames` are now emitted from real call sites, and
 * `scripts/audit-event-contracts.mjs` fails the build if a declared name loses
 * its producer — so the claim cannot quietly rot back into a lie.

 * caller's to handle. Call sites in this repo do not wrap these calls in
 * try/catch, precisely because that guarantee lives here.
