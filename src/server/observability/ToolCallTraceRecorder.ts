/**
 * ToolCallTraceRecorder — an ordered, replayable trace of tool calls.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * `ToolCallContextGuard.recordCall(toolName)` already sees every tool call, but
 * it keeps a COUNTER: `{ lastToolName, consecutiveCount }` — enough to answer
 * "is this the 3rd identical call in a row?" (the degenerate-loop warning) and
 * nothing else. A counter cannot answer any question that requires order:
 *
 *   - did the agent retry a failing tool with the SAME arguments, or change
 *     approach? (a counter per-session cannot tell a retry from a switch)
 *   - was there a phase structure — navigate, then instrument, then collect —
 *     or a flat grind through one tool?
 *   - which domains were touched, and did a failure ever get a follow-up call?
 *   - how long did calls take, and how large were the payloads that the
 *     offloader had to spill to disk?
 *
 * Those are exactly the dimensions the A²E paper (arXiv:2608.07346) calls
 * `tool` / `plan` / `efficiency`, scored on a standardized execution trace. Its
 * OTHER dimensions — reasoning quality, plan grade, skill/memory use — are
 * judged by an LLM over the agent's chain of thought. A tool SERVER never sees
 * that chain, so those are NOT ported here; pretending otherwise would produce
 * a metric that reads a number off nothing. What a server does own is the
 * action layer, and that layer is fully observable in this process.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE OBJECT INSTEAD OF CHANGING `recordCall`
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * `recordCall` is called from the hot execution path and its return value is
 * load-bearing (`enrichResponse` injects `repeatWarning` when the count trips).
 * Widening it to return a trace entry would change a public signature that
 * several call sites and tests depend on, for a consumer that has nothing to do
 * with repeat detection.
 *
 * So this recorder is a SEPARATE observer with its own lifecycle: the caller
 * that already knows a call happened (it has the duration, the domain, the
 * response) feeds one entry in. Nothing in the guard changes, and the recorder
 * can be attached, reset, or omitted per deployment without the guard knowing.
 *
 * PURE MEMORY, NO I/O
 * -------------------
 * Recording must never be the reason a tool call fails, and it must never do
 * blocking work on the execution path. This class therefore writes nothing:
 * `toJSONL()` returns a string, and the caller decides whether to persist it
 * (see `scripts/audit-tool-traces.mjs` for the offline analyzer). That also
 * keeps the class unit-testable without a temp directory.
 *
 * BOUNDED ON PURPOSE
 * ------------------
 * A long-running server that appends one entry per tool call forever is a memory
 * leak. The window is fixed (DEFAULT_MAX_ENTRIES) and the oldest entries are
 * dropped; `droppedEntries` is part of the snapshot so the loss is VISIBLE
 * rather than silent — a buffer that quietly discards is a defect this repo has
 * found in several places, and it is worse here than most, because a trace is
 * evidence: a truncated trace that claims to be complete is a false statement
 * about what the agent did, whereas one that reports "N dropped" is still
 * usable for the rate metrics below only if the caller knows the denominator.
